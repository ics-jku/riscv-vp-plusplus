# NOTE: Experimental Fast ISS Branch

This experimental branch of RISC-V VP++
 1. enables the Load/Store Cache (LSCache)
 2. contains and enables the experimental implementation of the Dynamic Basic Block Cache (DBBCache), and
 3. contains all ISS optimizations made possible by DBBCache

It contains a slightly improved version of the Fast Interpreter-Based Instruction Set Simulator as introduced in the paper
"Fast Interpreter-Based Instruction Set Simulation for Virtual Prototypes"
by Manfred Schlaegl and Daniel Grosse
presented at the Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference 2025.

This optimized VP allows experiments with RV64 and Linux ([GUI-VP Kit](https://github.com/ics-jku/GUI-VP_Kit)).
However, the branch is marked experimental because:
 1. RV32 implementation is not stable yet
 2. DBBCache and LSCache can not be disabled at runtime yet
 3. DBBCache can not be disabled at compile time yet

Once these issues are resolved, this branch will be merged back into the master.

(see TODOs in code)

# RISC-V VP++ (Fast interpreter ISS Experimental Branch)

*RISC-V VP++* is a extended and improved successor of the RISC-V based Virtual Prototype (VP) [RISC-V VP](https://github.com/agra-uni-bremen/riscv-vp).
It is maintained at the [Institute for Complex Systems](https://ics.jku.at/), Johannes Kepler University, Linz.

In Workshop on Open-Source Design Automation, 2024.](https://ics.jku.at/files/2024OSDA_RISCV-VP-plusplus.pdf), can be found in the last section.

### Key features of *RISC-V VP++*
 * Support for RV32E and RV64E
   (Can be enabled with the "--use-E-base-isa" command line option on riscv-vp, microrv32-vp and all tiny* vp platforms.)
 * Support for the *GD32VF103VBT6* microcontroller (*Nuclei N205*) including UI
   * More detailed information can be found [here](doc/GD32/README.md)
 * Support for *RISC-V "V" Vector Extension* (RVV) version 1.0
   * [Manfred Schlägl, Moritz Stockinger, and Daniel Große. A RISC-V "V" VP: Unlocking vector processing for evaluation at the system level. In DATE, 2024.](https://ics.jku.at/files/2024DATE_RISCV-VP-plusplus_RVV.pdf)
 * Full integration of [GUI-VP](https://github.com/ics-jku/GUI-VP), which enables the simulation of interactive graphical Linux applications
   * All further work on *GUI-VP* will take place here in *RISC-V VP++*
   * More detailed information can be found [here](doc/GUI-VP/README.md)
   * **Note: [GUI-VP Kit](https://github.com/ics-jku/GUI-VP_Kit) provides an easy-to-use build system and experimentation platform for RISC-V VP++, Linux and RVV**
 * Linux shutdown (stop simulation from within)
 * Linux RV32 and RV64, single and quad-core VPs
 * Harmonized coding style (make codestyle)
 * Based on [RISC-V VP](https://github.com/agra-uni-bremen/riscv-vp) (commit 9418b8abb5)

### Key features of the original *RISC-V VP*
(commit 9418b8abb5)

 - RV32GC and RV64GC core support (i.e. RV32IMAFDC and RV64IMAFDC)
 - Implemented in SystemC TLM-2.0
 - SW debug capabilities (GDB RSP interface) with Eclipse
 - Virtual Breadboard GUI (interactive IO) featuring C++ and Lua modeled digital devices (separate repository)
 - FreeRTOS, RIOT, Zephyr, Linux support
 - Generic and configurable bus
 - CLINT and PLIC-based interrupt controller + additional peripherals
 - Instruction-based timing model + annotated TLM 2.0 transaction delays
 - Peripherals, e.g. display, flash controller, preliminary ethernet
 - Example configuration for the SiFive HiFive1 (currently only Rev. A) board available
 - Support for simulation of multi-core platforms
 - Machine-, Supervisor- and User-mode (including user traps) privilege levels and CSRs
 - Virtual memory support (Sv32, Sv39, Sv48)

#### 1) Build requirements

Mainly the usual build tools and boost is required:

On Ubuntu 22, install these:
```bash
sudo apt install cmake autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo libgoogle-perftools-dev libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev libboost-iostreams-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-log-dev qtbase5-dev qt5-qmake libvncserver-dev
```

On Fedora, following actions are required:
```bash
sudo dnf install autoconf automake curl libmpc-devel mpfr-devel gmp-devel gawk bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib-devel expat-devel cmake boost-devel qt5-qtbase qt5-qtbase-devel libvncserver-devel
sudo dnf groupinstall "C Development Tools and Libraries"
#optional debuginfo
sudo dnf debuginfo-install boost-iostreams boost-program-options boost-regex bzip2-libs glibc libgcc libicu libstdc++ zlib
```

#### 2) Build this RISC-V Virtual Prototype:

**Note:** By default the VPs are build without optmization and debug symbols.
To enable the optimizations set the environment variable `RELEASE_BUILD=ON`.

To create an optimized release build, type
```
RELEASE_BUILD=ON make vps
```

To create a debug build without optimisations, type
```
RELEASE_BUILD=OFF make vps
```

#### 3) Building SW examples using the GNU toolchain

##### Requirements

In order to test the software examples, a configured RISC-V GNU toolchain is required in your `$PATH`.
Several standard packages are required to build the toolchain.
For more information on prerequisites for the RISC-V GNU toolchain visit https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain.
With the packages installed, the toolchain can be build as follows:

```bash
# in some source folder
git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
git submodule update --init --recursive # this may take a while
./configure --prefix=$(pwd)/../riscv-gnu-toolchain-dist-rv32imac-ilp32 --with-arch=rv32imac --with-abi=ilp32
make -j$(nproc)
```

If wanted, move the `riscv-gnu-toolchain-dist-rv32imac-ilp32` folder to your `/opt/` folder and add it to your path in your `~/.bashrc`
(e.g. `PATH=$PATH:/opt/riscv-gnu-toolchain-dist-rv32imac-ilp32/bin`)

##### Running the examples

In *sw*:

```bash
cd simple-sensor    # can be replaced with different example
make                # (requires RISC-V GNU toolchain in PATH)
make sim            # (requires *riscv-vp*, i.e. *vp/build/bin/riscv-vp*, executable in PATH)
```

Please note, if *make* is called without the *install* argument in step 2, then the *riscv-vp* executable is available in *vp/build/src/platform/basic/riscv-vp*.



This will also copy the VP binaries into the *vp/build/bin* folder.

#### FAQ

**Q:** How do I exit the VP?

**A:** All VPs use the input TTY in raw mode and forward all control
characters to the guest. For this reason, one cannot use Ctrl-c to exit
the VP. Instead, press Ctrl-a to enter command mode and press Ctrl-x to
exit the VP.

**Q:** How do I emit a Ctrl-a control character?

**A:** Enter control mode using Ctrl-a and press Ctrl-a again to send a
literal Ctrl-a control character to the guest.
